"Name:   Balin Banh, Samuel DindyalCourse: CPS506, Winter 2016, Assignment #2Due:    2016.02.28 23:59This is entirely our own work.The bulk of the work is done in WebCrawler.st, while Assignment2.st is used as a launcher.Tags, as well as their counts are kept track of using dictionaries.The code is kept as simple as possible, minimizing the lines of code needed, specifically in parsing html pages by usingregular expressions instead of algorithmically reading in characters. The procedure is done iteratively, with the best case scenario being a single web page, withno additional anchor tags."Object subclass: #Assignment2	instanceVariableNames: ''	classVariableNames: ''	poolDictionaries: ''	category: 'cps506'startOn: aString maxPages: anInteger maxPathLength: anInteger3 	|crawler|	crawler := WebCrawler new.	crawler initializeWithURL:aString withCurrentDepth:0 maxPathLength:anInteger3 andMaxDepth:anInteger.	crawler fetchHtml.	crawler parseHtml. "-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- "Assignment2 class	instanceVariableNames: ''startOn: aString maxPages: anInteger maxPathLength: anInteger3 	|crawler|	crawler := WebCrawler new.	crawler initializeWithURL:aString withCurrentDepth:0 maxPathLength:anInteger3 andMaxDepth:anInteger.	crawler fetchHtml.	crawler parseHtml.
